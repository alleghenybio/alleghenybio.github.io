  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>Allegheny Biosciences is a mission-driven company focused on bringing more and better drugs to market. The platform makes advanced drug discovery tools accessible to researchers everywhere, particularly for urgent challenges such as: antibiotic resistance, pandemic preparedness, rare diseases, and chronic conditions affecting millions.</p>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>While AI powers the advanced models and tools needed for modern drug discovery, it's the combination of these capabilities with human expertise and creativity that makes the real difference. Allegheny Biosciences brings together cutting-edge computational methods with an understanding of what researchers actually need to move from idea to viable therapeutic candidate.</p>
  
  <p>The platform draws from diverse molecular inspiration, including synthetic chemistry, natural products, and even venoms, recognizing that nature's complexity often surpasses what we can imagine from scratch.</p>

<section class="story" id="why">
  <h2>Why I Started This</h2>
  <p>With a background in biochemistry and clinical pharmacy, I've seen the different sides of therapeutics from the bench to the bedside. I know firsthand how effective medications improve and extend patients' lives. I've also seen the other reality: even commonly used drugs can cause serious adverse effects, complex regimens patients struggle to understand and follow, and unintended harm despite careful monitoring.</p>
  
  <p>These experiences drive me to explore how computational approaches can accelerate the discovery of better therapeutics. Modern tools can generate millions of molecules, but that's far from the end of the story. The real challenge is choosing the most promising candidates, optimizing their properties, and ensuring they can actually be made and tested.</p>
  
  <p>Allegheny Biosciences exists to bridge this gap, making sophisticated drug discovery accessible to the researchers, startups, and organizations working on humanity's most pressing health challenges.</p>
